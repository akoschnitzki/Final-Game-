# Final-Game-


Hello World,

Alex here, in the following files I was able to create my game and for it 
to be able to run. They all are able to run when you run the main game file since 
that is the start of the game. In my game, it is able to use functions to be able 
to help with making it run the way that I want it to run. It is able to run without 
having no errors that affect it. I want to be able to keep fixing it so that I can 
create the best game that I can be able to create. 

From Alex
